ORDER-IN-ORIGINAL No. AHM-EXCUS-002-COMMR- 1&" _ (2022-23

M/s. Prabhudas Becharbhai Patel, A-F-6, Dhanjibhai Complex, Nr.
Naranpura Railway Crossing, Naranpura, Ahmedabad -380013, were issued
SCN No. STC/15-40/0A/2021 dated 23.04.2021 by the Commissioner, Central

GST & Central Excise, Anmedabad North, Ahmedabad.

BRIEF FACTS OF THE CASE PERTAINING TO THE SCN ISSUED TO M/S.

PRABHUDAS BECHARBHAI PATEL, ARE AS FOLLOWS:

M/s. Prabhudas Becharbhai Patel, A-F-6, Dhanjibhai Complex, Nr.
Naranpura Railway Crossing, Naranpura, Ahmedabad -380013 (hereinafter
referred to as the 'Assessee' for the sake of brevity) engaged in providing taxable

services, were holding Service Tax Registration No. ACCPP3756ASD001.

2. Analysis of “Sales/Gross Receipts from Services (Value from ITR)”, the
“Total Amount Paid/Credited under 194C, 194H, 1941, 194J” and “Gross value
of Services Provided” in respect of M/s.Prabhudas Becharbhai Patel, was
undertaken by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) for the F.Y. 2015- 16
and 2016-17, and details of the said analysis were shared by the CBDT with the
Central Board of Indirect Taxes (CBIC).

3. As per the records available with the Divisional Office of Division-VII and
on going through the Third Party Data provided by CBDT of the said assessee
for the F.Y. 2015-16 and 2016-17, the service related taxable value declared in
their Income Tax Return/ Form 26AS were found to be not tallying with Gross
Value of Service Provided, as declared in ST-3 Return for the FY. 2015-16 and
2016-17. Therefore, it appeared that the said assessee had declared less/not
declared any taxable value in their Service Tax Returns (ST-3) for F.Y. 2015-16
and 2016-17 as compared to the Service related taxable value declared in
ITR/Form 26AS for the FY 2015-16 and 2016-17. The difference in value as
observed for F.Y. 2015-16 and 2016-17, was as under:

Sr. | Financial | Taxable’ Value Gross Receipt Difference Resultant Service
No. | Year as per ST-3 from Services Between Value of | tax short paid (in

STC/15-40/0A/2021

Therefore, it appeared that the said assessee had short paid /not paid
service tax to the extent of Rs. 2,22,79,814/- (including Cess) on the differential
value of Rs. 15,13,42,235/-.

4. Accordingly, the service tax liability of M/s.Prabhudas Becharbhai Patel
was worked out solely on the basis of income mentioned in ITR/Form 26AS,
which were shared by Income tax Department. The said income was considered
as the Total Taxable value in order to ascertain the service tax liability of the

assessee under Section 67 of the Finance Act, 1994.

5. As per Section 68 of the Finance Act, 1994, every person liable to pay
service tax shall pay service tax at the rate specified in Section 66B in such
manner and within such: period which is prescribed under Rule 6 of the Service

“

tax Rules 1994. no - 55

6. As per the provisions of Section 70 (Furnishing of Returns) of the Finance

Act, 1994:

“(1) Every person liable to pay the service tax shall himself assess the tax
due on the services provided by him and shall furnish to the Superintendent of
Central Excise, a return in such form and in such manner and at such frequency
and with such late fee not exceeding twenty thousand rupees, for delayed

furnishing of return, as may be prescribed.

(2) The person or class of persons notified under sub-section (2) of section
69, shall furnish to the Superintendent of Central Excise, a return in such form

and in such manner and at such frequency as may be prescribed.”

7. As per the provisions of Section 73(1) of the Finance Act,1994 where any
Service Tax has not been levied or paid or has been short levied or short paid by
reasons of willful mis-statement or suppression of facts with intent to evade
payment of Service Tax, the Central Excise Officer may within five years from the
relevant date, serve a notice on the person chargeable with Service Tax which
has not been levied or paid or which has been short levied or short paid requiring

him to show cause why he should not pay the amount specified in the notice.

8. As per Rule 6 of the Service Tax Rules, 1994, the Service Tax shall be paid
to the credit of the Central Government by 5% day of the month, immediately
following the said calendar month in which the payments are received, towards

the value of taxable service. Rule 7 of the Service Tax Rules, 1994 stipulates that

Page 2 of 32


STC/15-40/0A/2021

the assessee shall submit their Service Tax returns in the form ST-3 within the

prescribed time.

9. From the documentary evidence available at the relevant time, it appeared
that the said assessee had failed to pay/short paid/deposit Service Tax to the
extent of Rs. 2,22,79,814/- (including Cess) which was arrived at on the basis of
difference of taxable value declared in their ST-3 returns during the Financial
Year 2015-16 and 2016-17 vis-a-vis “Sales /Gross Receipts from Services (ITR)”
OR “Total Amount paid /Credited Under 194C, 194H, 1941, 194J” (as per Form
26AS). The said short payment appeared to have been done with intent to evade
payment of Service Tax. Accordingly, it appeared that the said assessee had
failed to discharge the Service Tax liability of Rs. 2,22,79,814/- {including Cess)
worked out on value of Rs. 15,13,42,235/- and therefore, the said Service Tax
was required to be demanded/recovered from them under Section 73(1) of the

Finance Act, 1994 read with Section 68 of the Finance Act, 1994.

10. Therefore, it appeared that the said assessee had (i) failed to declare
correctly, assess and pay the service tax due on the taxable services provided by
them and to maintain records and furnish returns, in such form i.e. ST-3 and in
such manner and at such frequency, as required under Section 70 of the Finance
Act, 1994 read with Rule 6 & 7 of the Service Tax Rules, 1994; (ii) failed to
determine the correct value of taxable service provided by them under Section
67 of the Finance Act, 1994; {iii) failed to pay the Service Tax correctly at the
appropriate rate within the prescribed time in the manner and at the rate as
provided under the said provision of Section 66B and Section 68 of the Finance
Act, 1994 and Rules 2 & 6 of the Service Tax Rules, 1994 in as much as they
had not paid service tax as worked out in the Table for Financial Year 2015-16
and 2016-17; (iv) contravened the provisions of Section 68, and 70 of the Finance
Act, 1994 read with rule 6, and 7 of Service Tax Rules, 1994 which appeared to
be punishable under the provisions of Section 78 of the Finance Act, 1994 as
amended from time to time; (vi) made themselves liable to pay interest at the
appropriate rates for the period from due date of payment of service tax till the
date of actual payment as per the provisions of Section 75 of the Finance Act,
1994; (vii) also contravened the provision of Rule 7 read with Section 70 of the

Finance Act, 1994 in as much as they failed to file ST-3 Returns by due date.

11. It had been noticed that at no point of time, the assessee had disclosed
full, true and correct information about the value of the services provided by

.. them or intimated to the Department regarding receipt/ providing of Services of

ae

STC/15-40/0A/2021

the differential value, that had come to the notice of the Department only after
going through the Third Party CBDT data generated for the Financial Year 20 15-
16 and 2016-17. From the evidences gathered/ available at the relevant time, it
appeared that the said assessee had knowingly suppressed the facts regarding
receipt of/providing of services by them, and thereby not paid/ short paid/not
deposited Service Tax thereof to the extent of Rs. 2,22,79,814/-. Thus, it
appeared that there was a deliberate withholding of essential and material
information from the department about service provided and value realized by
the assessee which were in direct contradiction with the spirit of self assessment

and faith reposed in the service provider by the government.

12. As per Section 75 ibid every person liable to pay the tax in accordance with
the provisions of Section 68, or rules made there under, who fails to credit the
tax or any part thereof to the account of the Central Government within the
period prescribed, is liable to pay simple interest (at such rate not below ten per
cent and not exceeding thirty six per cent per annum, as is for the time being
fixed by the Central Government, by Notification in the Official Gazette) for the
period by which such crediting of the tax or any part thereof is delayed. It
appeared that the said assessee had short paid/ not-paid Service Tax of Rs.

2,22,79,814/- on the actual value received towards taxable services provided
which appeared to be recoverable under proviso to Section 73(1) of the Finance
Act,1994 along with interest under Section 75 ibid not paid by them under
Section 68 of the Finarice Act read with Rule 6 of Service Tax Rules, 1994
inasmuch as the said assessee had suppressed the facts from the department
and had contravened the provisions with an intent to evade payment of Service:
Tax. The said assessee had not discharged its Service tax’ liability and hence

was liable to pay interest under Section 75 of the Finance Act.

13. All the above acts of contravention on the part of the said assessee
resulted into non-payment of Service Tax and they appeared to have been
committed by way of suppression of material facts and contravention of
provisions of Finance Act, 1994 with an intent to evade payment of Service Tax
as discussed in the foregoing paras and therefore, the Service Tax amounting to
Rs. 2,22,79,814/- (inclusive of Cess) not paid was required to be demanded and
recoverable from them under the proviso to Section 73(1) of the Finance Act,
1994 alongwith Interest thereof at appropriate rate under the provisions of

Section 75 of the Finance Act, 1994.
